# Visit the dashboard

Once you install Netdata, it immediately starts collecting thousands of metrics in real-time in the background. While
that might be useful, you probably want to see these metrics in action.

Netdata comes a preconfigured dashboard that automatically organizes metrics into hundreds of real-time, interactive,
and context-aware charts. These charts are designed by both our team and the community, and require no query languages,
or even an understanding of these metrics in the first place.

Time to open the dashboard, explore, and learn how to interact with charts to monitor and troubleshoot the performance
of your node.

## Open the dashboard

To open Netdata's dashboard, open a browser and navigate to `http://NODE:19999`, replacing `NODE` with either
`localhost` for the local system or the hostname/IP address of a remote system.

## Explore the dashboard

The best way to get started with Netdata for the first time is to explore. 

Netdata's dashboard puts all charts on a single page. To see more charts, scroll down or use the **menu** on the
right-hand side of the dashboard to navigate between **sections**, which are groups of closely-related charts.

submenus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80832425-7c528600-8ba1-11ea-8140-d0a17a62009b.gif)

For more information about the dashboard's key areas, see the [dashboards explanation
doc](/docs/dashboards/how-dashboards-work.mdx).

## Interact with charts

Every chart in the Netdata dashboard is fully interactive, and these interactions are synchronized across all charts.
Here's what that looks like:

Let's cover two of the most important ways to interact with charts: panning through time and zooming.

To pan through time, **click and hold** (or touch and hold) on any chart, then drag your mouse (or finger) to the left
or right. Dragging to the right pans backward through time, while dragging to the left pans forward in time. Think of it
like pushing the current timeframe off the screen so you can see what came before or after.

To zoom, press and hold `Shift` or `Alt`, then use your mouse's scrollwheel, or a two-finger pinch if you're using a
touchpad.

There's plenty other ways to [interact with charts](/docs/dashboards/interact-charts.mdx) if you're interested, but
for now, it's time to figure out what's next in your Netdata journey.

## What's next?

You've now visited Netdata's dashboard at `http://NODE:19999`, learned the basics of getting around, and learned how to
interact with charts by zooming and panning through time.

Where you go from here is based on your use case, immediate needs, and experience with monitoring and troubleshooting.
Here's some suggestions:

- [Interact with charts](/docs/dashboards/interact-charts.mdx)
- [Monitor multiple nodes in one place](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud)
- [Configure Netdata's settings or behavior](/docs/configure/nodes.md)
- [See metrics from a new data source](/docs/collect/how-collectors-work.md)
- [Change how long Netdata stores metrics](/docs/store/change-metrics-storage.md)
