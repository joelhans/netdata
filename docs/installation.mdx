# Install Netdata

Netdata is an open-source monitoring agent that collects thousands of hardware and software metrics from any physical or
virtual system (we call them _nodes_) and organizes them in easy-to-use and -navigate interface.

Together with Netdata Cloud, you can monitor your entire infrastructure in real time and easily troubleshoot problems
that threaten the health of your nodes before they occur.

Netdata runs permanently on all your physical/virtual servers, containers, cloud deployments, and edge/IoT devices. It
runs on Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and more), container/microservice platforms (Kubernetes clusters,
Docker), and many other operating systems (FreeBSD, macOS), with no `sudo` required.

## Install Netdata on Linux

The **recommended** way to install the Netdata Agent on a Linux system is our one-line [kickstart
script](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md). This script automatically installs dependencies and builds Netdata
from its source code.

> ⚠️ Many Linux distributions ship with third-party packages of Netdata, which we can't maintain and are often missing
> features. For the complete Netdata experience, use this one-line kickstart, or an [alternative method for
> Linux](/packaging/installer/README.md#alternative-methods).

Copy the script, paste it into your node's terminal, and hit `Enter`.

## Open the dashboard

To open Netdata's dashboard, open a browser and navigate to `http://NODE:19999`, replacing `NODE` with either
`localhost` for a local system, or the hostname/IP address of a remote system.

## Explore the dashboard

The best way to get started with Netdata for the first time is to explore. Netdata's dashboard puts all charts on a
single page. To see more charts, scroll down or use the **menu** on the right-hand side of the dashboard to navigate
between **sections**, which are groups of closely-related charts. 

![Animated GIF of using the menus and
submenus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80832425-7c528600-8ba1-11ea-8140-d0a17a62009b.gif)

For more information about the dashboard's key areas, see the [dashboards explanation
doc](/docs/dashboards/how-dashboards-work.mdx).

## Interact with charts

Every chart in the Netdata dashboard is fully interactive, and these interactions are synchronized across all charts.
Here's what that looks like:

![Animated GIF of the standard Netdata dashboard being manipulated and synchronizing
charts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80839230-b034a800-8baf-11ea-9cb2-99c1e10f0f85.gif)

Let's cover two of the most important ways to interact with charts: panning through time and zooming.

To pan through time, **click and hold** (or touch and hold) on any chart, then **drag your mouse** (or finger) to the
left or right. Dragging to the right pans backward through time, while dragging to the left pans forward in time. Think
of it like pushing the current timeframe off the screen so you can see what came before or after.

To zoom, press and hold `Shift` or `Alt`, then use your mouse's scrollwheel, or a two-finger pinch if you're using a
touchpad.

There's plenty other ways to [interact with charts](/docs/dashboards/interact-charts.mdx) if you're interested, but
for now, it's time to figure out what's next in your Netdata journey.

## What's next?

You've now installed Netdata, visited the dashboard at `http://NODE:19999`, learned the basics of getting around, and
learned how to interact with charts by zooming and panning through time.

Where you go from here is based on your use case, immediate needs, and experience with monitoring and troubleshooting.
Here's some suggestions:

### Dashboards 

Learn more about the [anatomy of the Netdata dashboard and charts](/docs/dashboards/dashboards-charts.mdx), or jump
straight in to the many ways to [interact with charts](/docs/dashboards/interact-charts.mdx).

### Configuration

Discover the recommended way to [configure Netdata's settings or behavior](/docs/configure/nodes.md) using our built in
`edit-config` script, then apply that knowledge to mission-critical tweaks, such as [changing how long Netdata stores
metrics](/docs/store/change-metrics-storage.md).

### Data collection

If you're not seeing certain metrics after installing Netdata, learn more about [how data collectors
work](/docs/collect/how-collectors-work.md), then configure your system/services to publish their metrics in a way that
Netdata autodetects.

### Alarms & notifications

Netdata comes with hundreds of preconfigured alarms, designed by our monitoring gurus in parallel with our open-source
community, but you may want to [edit alarms](/docs/monitor/configure-alarms.md) or [enable
notifications](/docs/monitor/enable-notifications.md) to customize your Netdata experience.

### Need to monitor multiple nodes in one place?

For robust infrastucture monitoring from a single interface, consider [Netdata
Cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud), which streams the metrics from multiple nodes to your browser, allowing
you to see
