# Customize the standard dashboard

Netdata stores information about individual charts in the `dashboard_info.js` file. This file includes section and
subsection headings, descriptions, colors, titles, tooltips, and other information for Netdata to render on the
dashboard.

For example, here is how `dashboard_info.js` defines the **System Overview** section.

```javascript
netdataDashboard.menu = {
  'system': {
    title: 'System Overview',
    icon: '<i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i>',
    info: 'Overview of the key system metrics.'
  },
```

If you want to customize this information, you should avoid editing `dashboard_info.js` directly. These changes are not
persistent; Netdata will overwrite the file when it's updated. Instead, you should create a new file with your
customizations.

We created an example file at `dashboard_info_custom_example.js`. You can copy this to a new file with a name of your
choice in the `web/` directory. This directory changes based on your operating system and installation method. If you're
on a Linux system, it should be at `/usr/share/netdata/web/`.

```shell
cd /usr/share/netdata/web/
sudo cp dashboard_info_custom_example.js your_dashboard_info_file.js
```

Edit the file with your customizations. For example:

```javascript
customDashboard.menu = {
  system: {
    title: "Testing, testing, 1 2 3",
    icon: '<i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i>',
    info: "This is overwritten info for the system overview section!"
  }
};
```

Finally, tell Netdata where you placed your customization file by replacing `your_dashboard_info_file.js` below.

```conf
[web]
 custom dashboard_info.js = your_dashboard_info_file.js
```

Once you restart Netdata, refresh the dashboard to find your custom configuration:
