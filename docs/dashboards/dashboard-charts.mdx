# Dashboard and charts

As soon as you [install Netdata](/docs/installation.mdx), it autodetects hardware, OS, containers, services, and
applications running on your node and builds a preconfigured dashboard on a single, scrollable webpage. This page
features hundreds of charts, which are also preconfigured to save you time from learning a query language, all stacked
on top of one another to encourage exploration and help you visually identify connections between the metrics visualized
in different charts.

To maximize your post-installation Netdata experience, it's important to understand the features and functionality of
Netdata's dashboard and charts.

## The dashboard

Netdata's dashboard can be broken down into four key areas:

1. [Charts and sections](#charts-and-sections)
2. [Menu/submenus](#menu-submenus)
3. [Time & date picker](#time-date-picker)
4. [Replicated nodes panel](#replicated-nodes-panel)
4. [Netdata Cloud functionality](#netdata-cloud-functionality)

dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/101509403-f7e59400-3935-11eb-9abd-cbecfa3ee49a.png)

### Charts and sections

The dashboard is a single page with many charts, which are automatically organized into **sections**, such as **System
Overview**, **CPU**, **Disk**, and more. Inside each section, you'll find a number of charts, broken down into
[contexts](/docs/dashboards/chart-dimensions-contexts-families.mdx#contexts) and
[families](/docs/dashboards/chart-dimensions-contexts-families.mdx#families).

Learn more about the [anatomy of charts](#charts) below, or skip ahead to the basics of [interacting with
charts](/docs/dashboards/interact-charts.mdx), such as panning through time, zooming in, or highlighting timeframes to
help you troubleshoot anomalies.

### Menus

The dashboard features a **menu** on the right-hand side, which is automatically populated with text and a link to every
section. Most metrics menu items will contain several **submenu** items, which oftentimes link to "subsections" of
charts. For example, the **network** submenu item links to a group of charts for system-wide network monitoring.

menus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80834638-f08f2880-8ba5-11ea-99ae-f610b2885fd6.png)

Some submenu items link to the various [families](/docs/dashboards/chart-dimensions-contexts-families.mdx#families)
Netdata automatically creates for multiple instances of a monitored resource. For example, a **Disks** menu with several
submenu entries for each disk drive and partition.

submenus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80834697-11577e00-8ba6-11ea-979c-92fd19cdb480.png)

### Time & date picker

The dashboard features a time & date picker to help you visualize specific timeframes of historical metrics. The picker
chooses an appropriate default to always show per-second granularity based on the width of your browser's viewport.

See the doc on [picking timeframes](/docs/dashboards/pick-timeframes.mdx) for more details.

### Replicated Nodes panel

If you're using [streaming](/streaming/README.md), both the parent and child nodes appear in the Replicated Nodes panel,
which appears on the left-hand side of the dashboard. Click either link to switch between the various dashboards for
your streaming-enabled nodes.

![Switching between parent and child streaming

Show or hide this panel using the **hamburger** icon (![Export
icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/netdata-ui/master/src/components/icon/assets/hamburger.svg)) next to the
Netdata logo.

### Netdata Cloud functionality

Any dashboard can connect to a Netdata Cloud account to enable additional functionality, such as quickly navigating to a
[War Room](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/war-rooms) or moving between recently-visited dashboards.

When enabled, click on any of the War Room or Spaces to open Netdata Cloud in a new tab and jump to that location.

Jump over to the [Netdata Cloud docs](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/) for more details on how and why you would choose to sign up and monitor multiple nodes from a single interface.

## Charts

A **chart** is an individual, interactive, always-updating graphic displaying one or more collected/calculated metrics.
Charts are generated by [collectors](/collectors/README.md).

Here's the system CPU chart, the first chart displayed on the standard dashboard:

![Screenshot of the system CPU chart in the Netdata
dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/114786663-5a5efe80-9d33-11eb-8316-4d9eec2e672f.png)

### Description

Many charts come with a short description of what dimensions the chart is displaying and why they matter. If you're new
to monitoring and troubleshooting, we recommend you spend some time reading these descriptions to learn more about why
you might care about something strange happening on a given chart and what you should do next.

### Name and context

Netdata displays a chart's name in parentheses above the chart. For example, if you navigate to the system CPU chart,
you'll see the label: **Total CPU utilization (system.cpu)**. In this case, the chart's name is `system.cpu`. Netdata
derives the name from the chart's [context](/docs/).

### Dimensions

### Axis

### Unit

### Legend

### Timetamp

### Interactions

### Positive and negative values on charts

To improve clarity on charts, Netdata dashboards present **positive** values for metrics representing `read`, `input`,
`inbound`, `received` and **negative** values for metrics representing `write`, `output`, `outbound`, `sent`.

![Screenshot showing positive and negative
values](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/81870401-9d649080-952a-11ea-80e3-4a7b480252ee.gif)

negative._

### Autoscaled y-axis

Netdata charts automatically zoom vertically, to visualize the variation of each metric within the visible timeframe.

axis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80838276-8084a080-8bad-11ea-8167-8d5ab2fb1be1.gif)
